List elements from the challenge that you think you have done well, and that exemplify your proficiency. Please describe why you chose those elements, and how they demonstrate your proficiency.

- Making the UI of the app, I think I have almost matched the UI to the designs given to me
- Code reusability, making reusable components where ever possible has reduced the redundant work and improved the proficiency
- Code quality and readability. You will a pattern of every component, first comes hooks,then constants then useEffect hooks if any and so on, which makes reading of code predictable and fast

List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours available for this task. Describe why you would do those things.

- Make the UI even better
- Intead of search on search button click, will implement search on keystroke
